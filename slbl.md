Course Description:  

The organization and structure of modern operating systems. System level programming on Linux and Windows operating systems.
The course covers - operating system concepts and components, processes, threads, synchronization (mutex, semaphores, condition variables), deadlock, CPU scheduling, memory management, file systems, device drivers.

Students are required to demonstrate intermediate knowledge of software and hardware systems related to computational sciences.

Students are required to complete individual projects related to system programming (threads, processes, drivers).

Three hours of instructor-led class time per week including discussions and problem sets.


Required Materials: 
Andrew Tanenbaum: Modern Operating Systems.
Andrew Tanenbaum, Albert S. Woodhull: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (The Minix book).
Brian Kernighan, Rob Pike: The Unix Programming Environment.
